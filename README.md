# Building-a-Postgres-Database-for-Crime-Reports

In this project, I built a Postgres database for storing data related to crimes in Boston. Within this database, I create a schema and tables, as well as users and groups to grant permissions. I also optimize each column of this database to improve run times and storage needed.
